# PokeAPI Streamlit Connector

This project includes an implementation of the `ExperimentalBaseConnection` Streamlit class for
the PokeAPI REST API. 

It currently implements pulling all available endpoints, all resources within and endpoint or 
the information for one specific endpoint. 

This project conciously does not use an existing API wrapper, as they are unmaintained and 
have not been verified working on current Python versions.

There is also a reference [Streamlit App](https://pokeapi-connector.streamlit.app) that shows 
how to use the connector.
